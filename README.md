Guide to Optical Imagery and Machine Learning Classification of Surface Water on Ice

This document contains information on how to find, visualise, download and manipulate optical satellite imagery for the Sentinel-2 and Landsat mission sensors, and how to train, test and execute scripts for the classification of ponded water on the surface of ice and/or snow.

This document was compiled by Diarmuid Corr, Lancaster University (d.corr@lancaster.ac.uk, https://github.com/diarmuidcorr) and details the work developed for his PhD project.

The satellite imagery download script to fetch Landsat & Sentinel data was developed by Vasco Nunes (https://github.com/vascobnunes/fetchLandsatSentinelFromGoogleCloud).

The Random Forest scripts are based on a classification script developed by Chris Holden (http://ceholden.github.io/open-geo-tutorial/python/chapter_5_classification.html).

Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Diarmuid Corr (d.corr@lancaster.ac.uk).
